[simpson home] (little boy): but why cant we just make a law against flag-burning

[simpson home] (bart simpson): what the hell is this
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): its one of those campy 70s throwbacks that appeals to generation xers

[simpson home] (little boy): what if people say youre not good enough to be in the constitution
[simpson home] (amendment): then ill crush all opposition to me and ill make ted kennedy pay if he fights back ill say that hes gay

[simpson home] (lisa simpson): bart look at this
[itchy scratchy studios] (bart simpson): what a perfect plan now roger myers hotel is just around the--
[itchy scratchy studios] (roger myers, jr.): and so when no one could think of a plan to resurrect itchy and scratchy a young boy a wonderful irrepressible young boy took it on his own to solve the problem
[itchy scratchy studios] (roger myers, jr.): he discovered that the postal services mr zip was just a rip-off of my fathers stick figure character manic mailman
[itchy scratchy studios] (roger myers, jr.): so the government gave me a huge cash settlement and itchy and scratchy studios is back in business thanks to you lester
[itchy scratchy studios] (bart simpson): what the hell is going on
[itchy scratchy studios] (lisa simpson): i dont know but it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden

[itchy scratchy studios] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): i too owe many thanks to lester and eliza this is a great vindication for anybody who was ever taking a bath went to get the paper fell down and had the door slam behind them and the doorknob break off
[itchy scratchy studios] (krusty the clown): and id like to thank lester for reuniting me with my estranged wife
[itchy scratchy studios] (bart simpson): i never even heard about that
[itchy scratchy studios] (lisa simpson): i dont understand it were always the ones who solve these problems
[itchy scratchy studios] (bart simpson): i guess you dont need it now but we had a plan too
