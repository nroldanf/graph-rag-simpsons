[simpson home] (marge simpson): well tell us your version
[simpson home] (homer simpson): now granted i was just a kid but i say
[simpson home] (homer simpson): grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so id never get the toy i actually wanted--
[simpson home] (homer simpson): and then and then wha and then what happened what gee my story doesnt make much sense except the santa part
[simpson home] (bart simpson): yeah but at least it was short
[simpson home] (homer simpson): wait wait theres one part of the story even grampa didnt know about a few months later i went to rescue bongo
[country road - near miss viola farm] (miss viola): hendrix cmere boy

[country road - near miss viola farm] (marge simpson): oh homie im so sorry
[country road - near miss viola farm] (homer simpson): well thats just the way dogs are the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made
[country road - near miss viola farm] (grampa simpson): homer maybe you should take a look at this
[country road - near miss viola farm] (grampa simpson): a christmas card i got from miss viola years later
[country road - near miss viola farm] (homer simpson): he still has my sweatshirt
[country road - near miss viola farm] (grampa simpson): bongo didnt forget you unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away years ago oh they were fickle as hell
[country road - near miss viola farm] (grampa simpson): bongo didnt forget you unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away they were fickle as hell
[country road - near miss viola farm] (homer simpson): oh my god dad i owe you an apology you saved bongo i never understood that till now
[country road - near miss viola farm] (grampa simpson): all these years i thought you loved that dog more than me
[country road - near miss viola farm] (homer simpson): why would you think that just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food
[country road - near miss viola farm] (grampa simpson): aw give me a hug son
