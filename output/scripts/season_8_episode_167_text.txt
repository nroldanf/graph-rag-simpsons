[springfield mall] (moderator): so you want a realistic down-to-earth show thats completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots

[springfield mall] (ralph wiggum): mommy
[springfield mall] (lisa simpson): um excuse me sir the thing is theres not really anything wrong with the itchy and scratchy show -- its as good as ever but after so many years the characters just cant have the same impact they once had
[springfield mall] (roger meyers, jr.): thats it thats it little girl youve saved itchy and scratchy
[springfield mall] (blue-haired lawyer): please sign these papers indicating that you did not save itchy and scratchy
[itchy scratchy studios] (roger meyers, jr.): i have figured out how to rejuvenate the show it is so simple you egghead writers woulda never thought of it what we need is a new character one that todays kids can relate to
[itchy scratchy studios] (writer #1): are you absolutely sure thats wise sir i mean i dont want to sound pretentious here but itchy and scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad
[itchy scratchy studios] (krusty the clown): hey this aint art its business what do you got in mind -- sexy broad gangster octopus
[itchy scratchy studios] (roger meyers, jr.): no no the animal chain of command goes mouse cat dog d-o-g
[itchy scratchy studios] (writer #2): a dog isnt that a tad predictable
[itchy scratchy studios] (executive): in your dreams were talking the original dog from hell

[itchy scratchy studios] (executive): we at the network want a dog with attitude hes edgy hes in-your-face youve heard the expression lets get busy well this is a dog who gets biz-zay consistently and thoroughly
[itchy scratchy studios] (krusty the clown): so hes proactive huh
[itchy scratchy studios] (executive): oh god yes were talking about a totally outrageous paradigm

[itchy scratchy studios] (roger meyers, jr.): i love it

[the android dungeon baseball card shop] (comic book guy): worst episode ever
[the android dungeon baseball card shop] (kent brockman): it looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable itchy and scratchy program for years tv critics such as yours truly kent brockman have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the shows hilarious facade yesterday our prayers were finally answered when poochie the dog made his howlingly unfunny debut far be it from me to gloat at anothers downfall but i have a feeling no children are going to be crying when this puppy is put to sleep
[itchy scratchy studios] (krusty the clown): what the hell happened
[itchy scratchy studios] (executive): well id attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic coupled with the overall crumminess of poochie
[itchy scratchy studios] (krusty the clown): whoa you gotta stop this thing please im gettin egged on the street do something do something
[itchy scratchy studios] (krusty the clown): uh hi mr myers ive been doing some thinking and ive got some ideas to improve the show i got it right here uh one poochie needs to be louder angrier and have access to a time machine two whenever poochies not on screen all the other characters should be asking wheres poochie three--
[itchy scratchy studios] (roger meyers, jr.): great great just leave them right there on the floor on your way out
[hallway] (roger meyers, jr.): listen guys we gotta do something about poochie
