[military academy] (lisa simpson): will you stop looking at your feet
[military academy] (commandant): well cadets its been a great year youve all worked very hard developing academic skills and general killing skills
[military academy] (bart simpson): my killing teacher says im a natural
[military academy] (commandant): but these skills are nothing without courage and stamina traditionally the academy tested these virtues by pitting you against each other in a two-day battle royale
[military academy] (commandant): that was prior to 1957 thank you very much state supreme court consequently now no cadet can receive a passing grade for the academic year without first conquering this
[military academy] (commandant): meet the eliminator thats a 150 foot hand-over-hand crawl across a 60 gauge hemp-jute line with a blister factor of twelve the rope is suspended a full forty feet over a solid british acre of old-growth connecticut valley thorn bushes gentlemen welcome to flavor country
[military academy] (lisa simpson): this wasnt in the brochure
[military academy] (cadets): yo bart over here etc
