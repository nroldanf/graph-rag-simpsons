[well] (seymour skinner): hes a liar
[well] (crowd): booooooo
[well] (kent brockman): the circumference of the well is thirty-four inches so unfortunately not one member of our citys police force is slender enough to rescue the boy
[well] (chief wiggum): by god men -- youre a bunch of marshmallows
[well] (fat cop): why dont you go chief
[well] (chief wiggum): im too important
[well] (kent brockman): although the well is too dark to see the boy timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock thus any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig
[well] (kent brockman): in desperation the city is considering more unorthodox solutions
[well] (falcon man): grasping the child firmly in his talons socrates here will fly him to safety just watch
[well] (falcon man): i dont think hes coming back
[well] (sailor): with this hook and this hunk of chocolate ill land your boy and ill clean him for free
[well] (professor jonathan frink): although we cant reach your boy we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him
[simpson home] (marge simpson): dear lord before we peel the foil back from your bounty we ask you to watch over little timmy otoole trapped in that well
[simpson home] (marge simpson): bart whats wrong with you
[simpson home] (homer simpson): yeah that timmy is a real hero
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): how do you mean dad
[simpson home] (homer simpson): well he fell down a well and cant get out
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): how does that make him a hero
[simpson home] (homer simpson): well its more than you did
[simpson home] (kent brockman): and finally channel sixs own krusty the clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called were sending our love down the well

[simpson home] (sting): yeah i used to open for krusty in uh 69 in fact he fired me as i recall
[simpson home] (krusty the clown): sting
[simpson home] (sting): but this isnt about show business this is about some kid down a hole or something and weve all got to do what we can
