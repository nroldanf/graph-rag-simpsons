[simpson living room] (c. montgomery burns): or so i thought at the last moment smithers drunk as a lemur lurched out of the darkness and fired
[simpson living room] (waylon smithers): thats right just before id shot jasper i was busy that night
[simpson living room] (c. montgomery burns): stricken i lurched forth in search of aide
[simpson living room] (c. montgomery burns): but finding only slack-jawed gawkers i gave up and collapsed on the sundial

[simpson living room] (marge simpson): well im just relieved that homers safe and youre recovered and we can all get back to normal
[simpson living room] (c. montgomery burns): not exactly smithers for attempting to kill me im giving you a five percent pay cut
[simpson living room] (troy mcclure): but of course for that ending to work you would have to ignore all the simpson dna evidence and that would be downright nutty
[simpson living room] (troy mcclure): yes the simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts who knows what adventures theyll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable im troy mcclure and ill leave you with what we all came here to see -- hard-core nudity
