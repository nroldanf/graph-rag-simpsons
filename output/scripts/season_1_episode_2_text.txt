[skinner office] (homer simpson): what have you done this time boy
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): i caught your son defacing school property this morning we estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and frankly we think its terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill
[skinner office] (homer simpson): yeah its a crummy system but what are you gonna do
[skinner office] (homer simpson): oh no he cant mean that
[skinner office] (homer simpson): my wife thinks you want me to pay for it
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): that was the idea
[skinner office] (homer simpson): oh
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): by itself something like this might not call for an extreme penaltybut this is not an isolated incident barts behavior is unruly hes frequently absent from school then gives teachers pathetic excuse notesthat are obviously childish forgeries when compared to
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): well at any rate it is my reluctant decision --
[skinner office] (secretary): mr skinner doctor pryor is here to see you he says its urgent
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): send him in

[skinner office] (bart simpson): wow its like youre readin my mind man
[skinner office] (dr. j. loren pyror): a-ha you see when a child with barts intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person hes probably going to lash out in ways like these
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): i think we should re-test him
[skinner office] (dr. j. loren pyror): no no i think we should move him to another school
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): oh better yet
[skinner office] (dr. j. loren pyror): bart wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers a school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to does that sound good bart

[skinner office] (homer simpson): doc this is all too much i mean my son a genius -- how does it happen
[skinner office] (dr. j. loren pyror): well genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment
