[bart treehouse] (bart simpson): wait a minute thats a schoolbook
[bart treehouse] (lisa simpson): dont worry bart you wont learn anything
[bart treehouse] (lisa simpson): its called the raven
[chamber] (lisa simpson): once upon a midnight dreary
[chamber] (lisa simpson): while i pondered weak and weary
[chamber] (v.o.): over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
[chamber] (homer simpson): huh
[chamber] (v.o.): as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
[chamber] (homer simpson): tis some visitor
[chamber] (v.o.): i muttered
[chamber] (homer simpson): -- tapping at my chamber door -- only this and nothing more
[chamber] (bart simpson): are we scared yet
[chamber] (lisa simpson): bart hes establishing mood
[chamber] (v.o.): ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow -- vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow
[chamber] (v.o.): -- sorrow for the lost lenore --
[chamber] (homer simpson): oh lenore
[chamber] (v.o.): for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore -- nameless here for evermore
[chamber] (homer simpson): aag
[chamber] (v.o.): and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
[chamber] (homer simpson): tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- this it is and nothing more
[chamber] (v.o.): presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
[chamber] (homer simpson): sir --
[chamber] (v.o.): -- said i --
[chamber] (homer simpson): -- or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you
[chamber] (v.o.): here i opened wide the door --
[chamber] (bart simpson): this better be good
[chamber] (v.o.): darkness there and nothing more
[chamber] (bart simpson): you know what would have been scarier than nothing
[chamber] (lisa simpson): what
[chamber] (bart simpson): anything
[chamber] (v.o.): back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before
[chamber] (homer simpson): surely --
[chamber] (v.o.): -- said i --
[chamber] (homer simpson): -- surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --
[chamber] (v.o.): open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door -- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door -- perched and sat and nothing more
[chamber] (homer simpson): though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou --
[chamber] (v.o.): i said --
[chamber] (homer simpson): -- art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -- tell me tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
[chamber] (v.o.): quoth the raven
[chamber] (bart simpson): eat my shorts
[chamber] (lisa simpson): bart stop it he says nevermore thats all hell ever say
[chamber] (bart simpson): okay okay
[chamber] (v.o.): then methought the air grew denser perfumed by some unseen censer
[chamber] (homer simpson): ouch censer
[chamber] (v.o.): swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor
[chamber] (homer simpson): wretch --
[chamber] (v.o.): i cried --
[chamber] (homer simpson): -- thy god hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore
[chamber] (v.o.): quoth the raven
[chamber] (raven): nevermore
[chamber] (homer simpson): be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend
[chamber] (v.o.): i shrieked of starting
[chamber] (homer simpson): get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore oh leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken -- quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
[chamber] (v.o.): quoth the raven
[chamber] (raven): nevermore
[chamber] (homer simpson): take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
[chamber] (v.o.): quoth the raven
[chamber] (raven): nevermore
[chamber] (homer simpson): why you little --
[chamber] (raven): uh-oh
[chamber] (homer simpson): come back here now raven
[chamber] (bart simpson): nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore
[chamber] (v.o.): and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted -- nevermore
[bart treehouse] (bart simpson): lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem
[bart treehouse] (lisa simpson): well it was written in 1845 maybe people were easier to scare back then
[bart treehouse] (bart simpson): well yeah like when you look at friday the 13th part i its pretty tame by todays standards
[bart treehouse] (marge simpson): children bedtime
[bart treehouse] (bart simpson): i guess ill have no trouble gettin to sleep tonight
