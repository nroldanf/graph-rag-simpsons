[cafÉ artiste gelato] (lisa simpson): what
[cafÉ artiste gelato] (klaus ziegler): i painted it me klaus ziegler
[cafÉ artiste gelato] (homer simpson): who
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): this is where i painted your so-called oldenveldt
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): prove it
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): oh crap
[zeigler studio] (lisa simpson): youre a forger
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): forger is such a cruel word im an art forger
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): your painting was an early clumsy effort which i gave to the café owner to pay off my strupo tab
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): then why did the auction house say it was real
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): i have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler
[zeigler studio] (lisa simpson): what you do is horrible ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): perhaps you are the one who is horrible
[zeigler studio] (lisa simpson): what
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): you only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous
[zeigler studio] (lisa simpson): well no but now when i look at it all ill see is a fraud
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): beauty is beauty my forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): the only real question to ask about art whether its in the louvre or on a freshmans wall at cal state fullerton is did it move you
[zeigler studio] (lisa simpson): but you still i mean i suppose youre right
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): what if i never liked the painting and only wanted it for money
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): then you i respect
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): oh great the painting is worthlessthis was all for nothing and when marge finds out shes gonna kill me
[zeigler studio] (klaus ziegler): well on that front perhaps i can be of assistance if theres one thing art is good for its to melt the frost which often hardens a womans heart
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): while youre at it could you make me a couple more
[zeigler studio] (homer simpson): ill pay you in strupo
[simpson home] (marge simpson): oh perfect now thats art
[simpson home] (homer simpson): rockin
[simpson home] (narrator): the gray troll brine of madness angels urine all names for the mysterious elixir known as strupo though this fermented caper solution was originally used to dissolve seagull corpses local alcoholics soon found strupo to be a palatable drink of last resort the noxious liqueur causes powerful olfactory hallucinations gender confusion and wandering mouth so if you visit isla verde be sure to say ahoy to the crushing addiction of strupo strupo lose everything
