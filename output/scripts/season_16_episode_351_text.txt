[calmwood] (homer simpson): real
[calmwood] (homer simpson): not real
[calmwood] (homer simpson): real
[calmwood] (homer simpson): real
[calmwood] (dr. julius hibbert): oh sorry homer but recent historical evidence indicates that robin hood did not actually exist
[calmwood] (homer simpson): fascinating

[calmwood] (homer simpson): oh kids i heart you too
[calmwood] (homer simpson): man im glad to be off that electro-shock table although to be honest i did enjoy lying down
[calmwood] (ray magini): hello homer
[calmwood] (homer simpson): its ray i see him again monster you dont exist
[calmwood] (ray magini): hey no one calls me a monster and questions my existence
[calmwood] (homer simpson): the awesome power of the human mind
[calmwood] (marge simpson): i see ray too
[calmwood] (bart simpson): so do i
[calmwood] (dr. julius hibbert): uh-oh well im not worried youve already agreed not to sue me for anything
[calmwood] (marge simpson): when did i agree to that
[calmwood] (dr. julius hibbert): you did when i validated your parking
[calmwood] (marge simpson): you didnt validate my parking
[calmwood] (dr. julius hibbert): check and mate
[calmwood] (homer simpson): so ray does exist
[calmwood] (ray magini): thats right now lets explore the improbable series of events that led to this amusing yet tragic farce
[calmwood] (bartender): on account of my eye patch i couldnt see ray sitting at the bar
[calmwood] (bartender): all i saw was you eatin and drinkin and talkin to yourself
[calmwood] (ray magini): and ned you didnt see me because i was hiding behind the chimney
[calmwood] (ned flanders): gee i thought my vision was perfect and here i was worshiping false eyeballs
[calmwood] (bart simpson): wait wait wait wait how come at builders barn i saw homer talking to thin air
[calmwood] (ray magini): well that hm
[calmwood] (dr. stephen hawking): i can answer that
[calmwood] (dr. stephen hawking): ive been tracking a tear in the fabric of space-time which combined with airborne pieces of metal at builders barn to create a miniature black hole this anomaly interposed itself between homer and bart causing a gravitational lens which absorbed the light reflected from ray the roofer
[calmwood] (lisa simpson): that seems feasible
[calmwood] (marge simpson): wait theres still one last thing that doesnt make sense why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear
[calmwood] (ray magini): thats easy -- im a contractor
[calmwood] (marge simpson): thats right -- youre all crooks
[calmwood] (ray magini): yeah yeah yeah were all crooks its true
[calmwood] (homer simpson): wait a minute i went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding somebody owes me big
[calmwood] (dr. julius hibbert): well homer i could make it up to you maybe a free eye-scraping
[calmwood] (homer simpson): thats a given theres something else something much more else
[simpson home] (dr. julius hibbert): homer can i please knock off ive got surgery in the morning
