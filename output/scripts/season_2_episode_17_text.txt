[tv studio] (c. montgomery burns): -- by the time this paid political announcement is done every johnny lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand
[studio] (c. montgomery burns): oh hello friends im montgomery burns your next governor and im here to talk to you about my little friend here blinky
[studio] (c. montgomery burns): many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation nothing could be further from the truth but dont take my word for it lets ask an actor portraying charles darwin what he thinks
[studio] (charles darwin): hello mr burns
[studio] (c. montgomery burns): oh hello charles be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection
[studio] (charles darwin): glad to mr burns you see every so often mother nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth sharper claws longer legs or in this case a third eye and if these variations turn out to be an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth
[studio] (c. montgomery burns): so youre saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish it may in fact be a kind of super fish
[studio] (charles darwin): i wouldnt mind having a third eye would you
[studio] (c. montgomery burns): no you see friends if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant theyd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman
[studio] (c. montgomery burns): the truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that cant be beat mmmm mmmm so to summarize say what you want about me i can take the slings and arrows but stop slandering poor defenseless blinky good night and god bless
[studio] (singers): only a moron wouldnt cast his votefor monty burns
[moe tavern] (barney gumble): wow super fish
[moe tavern] (moe szyslak): i wish the government would get off his back
[springfield retirement castle] (grampa simpson): that burns is just what this state needs young blood

[burns office] (danielson): six but were on our way
[burns office] (mary bailey): my worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools i however prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment
[burns office] (c. montgomery burns): and i say taxes are too high
[burns office] (c. montgomery burns): have you found any dirt on mary bailey
[burns office] (investigator #1): well weve gone through her garbage
