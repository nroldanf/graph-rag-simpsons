[springfield nuclear power plant] (c. montgomery burns): compadres it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters before the start of the rainy season and remember a shiny new donkey for whoever brings me the head of colonel montoya
[springfield nuclear power plant] (c. montgomery burns): huh what and by that i mean of course its time for the worker of the week award i cant believe weve overlooked this weeks winner for so very very long we simply could not function without his tireless efforts so a round of applause for this inanimate carbon rod
[springfield nuclear power plant] (homer simpson): inanimate huh ill show him inanimate

[simpson home] (nasa announcer #1): its a lovely day for a launch here live at cape canaveral at the lower end of the florida peninsula and the purpose of todays mission is truly really electrifying
[simpson home] (nasa announcer #2): thats correct tom the lion share of this flight will be devoted to the study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny screws
[simpson home] (nasa announcer #1): unbelievable and just imagine the logistics of weightlessness and of course this could have literally millions of applications here on earth in everything from watch making to watch repair
[simpson home] (homer simpson): boring

[simpsons base housing living room] (kent brockman): ladies and gentlemen weve just lost the picture but uh what weve seen speaks for itself the corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over conquered if you will by a master race of giant space ants its difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive earthmen or merely enslave them one thing is for certain there is no stopping them the ants will soon be here and i for one welcome our new insect overlords id like to remind them that as a trusted tv personality i can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves
[simpsons base housing living room] (marge simpson): dont worry kids im sure your fathers all right

[mission control] (james taylor): ants huh we had quite a severe ant problem at the vineyard this year i had art garfunkel come by with his compressor and we created a total vacuum outside the house and we blew the ants out the front door but im sure you high-tech nasa people could care less about our resort town ways
