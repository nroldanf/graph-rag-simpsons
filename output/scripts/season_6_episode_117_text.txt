[observatory] (superfriends): we are the superfriends
[observatory] (bart simpson): hey shut up
[observatory] (male astronomer): dear god
[observatory] (female astronomer): warren weve talked about you hogging the eyepiece
[springfield] (grampa simpson): sounds like the doomsday whistle aint been blown for nigh on to three years
[springfield] (jasper beardly): trouble a brewin
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): fellow citizens when i learned about the impending crisis i caught the very next plane to springfeld - field
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): first of all yes there is a comet in the sky and yes it is going to hit springfield
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): you uh dont need to applaud that now heres what we think the impact might look like show them jerry
[springfield town hall] (moe szyslak): oh dear god no
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): fortunately we have a plan professor frink
[springfield town hall] (professor jonathan frink): good evening ladies and
[springfield town hall] (panicked man): quit stalling whats the plan
[springfield town hall] (professor jonathan frink): alright just take your seat just take your seat
[springfield town hall] (professor jonathan frink): now working with former carter administration officials and military men who were forced into early retirement for various reasons which we wont go into here we have planned this defense for the city
[springfield town hall] (professor jonathan frink): as the comet hurtles toward the city our rocket will intercept it and blow it to smithereens
[springfield town hall] (moe szyslak): oh dear god no
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): and that will be the end of mr comet
[springfield town hall] (townspeople): yay were saved etc

[simpson car] (lisa simpson): but dad dont you think
[simpson car] (homer simpson): lisa the whole reason we have elected officials is so we dont have to think all the time just like that rain forest scare a few years back our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it didnt they
[simpson car] (lisa simpson): no dad i dont think
[simpson car] (homer simpson): theres that word again
[simpson home] (marge simpson): homer what if this doesnt work
[simpson home] (homer simpson): well then i have a back-up plan see while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo
[simpson home] (bart simpson): dad the plan
[simpson home] (homer simpson): im getting to that so anyway theyre going doo-dee-doo-do-doo
[simpson home] (bart simpson): dad
[simpson home] (homer simpson): so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town while all the while theyre still going doo-dee-doo-do-doo

[simpson home] (rev. timothy lovejoy): its all over people we dont have a prayer
[simpson home] (kent brockman): and like icarus the rocket foolishly soared too high and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism leaving us with some six hours to live so lets go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town with arnie pye and arnie in the sky
[simpson home] (arnie pye): with the bridge gone and the airport unfortunately on the other side of the bridge a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars
[simpson home] (arnie pye): its a silent testament to the never give up and never think things out spirit of our citizens
[simpson home] (kent brockman): with our utter annihilation imminent our federal government has snapped into action we go live now via satellite to the floor of the united states congress
[house of representative] (congressman #1): then it is unanimous we are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of springfield in the great state of
[house of representative] (congressman #2): wait a second i want to tack on a rider to that bill thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts

[house of representative] (congress): boo
[house of representative] (congressman #1): bill defeated
[house of representative] (kent brockman): ive said it before and ill say it again democracy simply doesnt work now over the years a newsman learns a number of things that for one reason or another he just cannot report it doesnt seem to matter now so the following people are gay
