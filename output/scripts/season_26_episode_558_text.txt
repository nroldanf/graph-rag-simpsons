[simpson home] (professor farnsworth): the human dna in the creatures was only half homers the other half came from someone else
[simpson home] (professor jonathan frink): oh so we can kill that person instead maybe theyre evil and deserve it or have one of those annoying voi-ces that gets on everybodys nerves with the adding extra noises for no reason bloing bloing

[simpson home] (bart simpson): well
[simpson home] (bart simpson): let this be a lesson never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): thats it all we have to do is dig up the time capsule
[simpson home] (leela): and bury bart in the hole
[simpson home] (marge simpson): i thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love like in epcot center
[simpson home] (leela): in our time epcot center is a work farm for the weak
