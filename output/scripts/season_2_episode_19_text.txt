[miniature golf] (homer simpson): woo-hoo-hoo
[miniature golf] (ned flanders): mercy is for the weak todd
[miniature golf course] (british commentator): if one were to look up courage in the oxford english dictionary one might very well come upon a photo of these two gladiators they approach the final hole in the shadow of the great emancipator deadlocked at eight strokes on the happy side of par soon one man will emerge triumphant he will drink naught but champagne while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in this oft cruel game
[miniature golf course] (ned flanders): its okay son you can recover
