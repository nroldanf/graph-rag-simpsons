[courtroom] (homer simpson): i thought he was dead
[courtroom] (seymour skinner): i suppose youre all wondering where ive been it all started a week ago i was at my desk revising and updating the school dress codes when

[skinner office] (louie): we really think theres promise in the boy
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): get out
[skinner office] (fat tony): okay okay you dont have to yell
[skinner garage] (seymour skinner): to get my mind off that ugly confrontation i went home and began bundling my old newspapers but suddenly the pile fell i was trapped let this be a lesson to recycle frequently
[skinner garage] (seymour skinner): for the next week i stayed alive by eating my mothers delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand i made a game of it seeing how many times i could bounce the ball in a day then trying to break that record occasionally the police arrived to search my home

[skinner garage] (seymour skinner): i formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube and remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher i concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges
[skinner garage] (seymour skinner): the rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord
[skinner garage] (seymour skinner): i grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom
[courtroom] (seymour skinner): and thats my courageous story
