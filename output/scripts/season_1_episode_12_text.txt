[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): good evening again springfield krusty the clown the beloved idol of countless tots now nothing more than a common alleged criminal his trial which begins tomorrow has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages from eight to eighty hang on each new development like so many rumanian trapeze artists
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): from his humble beginnings as a street mime in tupelo mississippi
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): -- with dozens of endorsements including his own line of pork products this may have led to one of televisions best-loved bloopers -- krustys near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986
[bart bedroom] (krusty the clown): wasnt that a great itchy and scratchy cartoon kids well weve got another one coming right up but first i got a hankerin for some pork products
[bart bedroom] (krusty the clown): mmmm look plump succulent sausage honey-smoked bacon and glistening sizzling
[bart bedroom] (krusty the clown): im dying im dying
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): but a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later krusty bounced back however he was a changed clown where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded tv mayhem
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): this new krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in todays anything-for-a- thrill youth
[bart bedroom] (krusty the clown): give a hoot read a book
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): krustys arrest has sent shock waves through springfield packing its churches synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life
[bart bedroom] (rev. timothy lovejoy): i urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of krusty that clown prince of corruption and join me in a public burning
[bart bedroom] (kent brockman): so is krusty the clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of springfield penitentiary well find out tomorrow when his trial begins
