[simpson home] (brockman): hello im kent brockman and welcome to another edition of smartline are cartoons too violent for children most people would say no of course not what kind of stupid question is that but one woman says yes shes here with us tonight mrs marge simpson

[tv studio] (roger meyers, jr.): thank you
[tv studio] (brockman): krusty the klown whose delightful program brings us the antics of itchy scratchy every afternoon at four
[tv studio] (krusty the clown): hi kent
[tv studio] (brockman): and joining us live via satellite from vienna the home of sigmund freud - the worlds most famous psychiatrist - to give us an insight into the human mind dr marvin monroe
[tv studio] (dr. marvin monroe): hiya
[tv studio] (brockman): now first lets see what all the excitement is about heres an example of the work currently being turned out at i s studios
[tv studio] (brockman): hilarious now what in the world is wrong with that mrs simpson
[tv studio] (roger meyers, jr.): theres nothing wrong with it
[tv studio] (marge simpson): excuse me excuse me he was addressing me
[tv studio] (roger meyers, jr.): i know theres nothing wrong with it
[tv studio] (marge simpson): excuse me there is i think that its a bad influence on children
[tv studio] (roger meyers, jr.): oh give me a break i think that is a bunch of baloney and heres why in preparing for this debate i did a little research and i discovered a startling thing there was violence in the past long before cartoons were invented
[tv studio] (brockman): i see fascinating
[tv studio] (roger meyers, jr.): yeah and there was something called the crusades for instance tremendous violence many people killed the darn thing went on for thirty years
[tv studio] (brockman): and this was before cartoons were invented
[tv studio] (roger meyers, jr.): thats right kent so much for your viewpoint
[tv studio] (brockman): dr marvin monroe in vienna would you care to comment on all this
[tv studio] (dr. marvin monroe): ah well kent to me the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day im im referring here to women who love too much fear of winning sexaholism stuff like that
[tv studio] (brockman): so you have no professional objection to itchy scratchy
[tv studio] (dr. marvin monroe): no not at all in fact one of my guilty little pleasures is to snuggle up with a big bucket of buttered popcorn dim the lights turn on itchy scratchy and laugh myself silly and what the hell is wrong with that
[tv studio] (brockman): not a thing now for another opinion
[tv studio] (krusty the clown): hi kids
[tv studio] (brockman): krusty please were giving you an opportunity to participate in a serious discussion here
[tv studio] (krusty the clown): oh im sorry kent its just that when the camera gets on me hey hey
[tv studio] (brockman): krusty
[tv studio] (krusty the clown): oh
[tv studio] (brockman): well it looks like were not going to settle this tonight mrs simpson in the nine seconds we have left could you summarize your position for us
[tv studio] (marge simpson): yes id like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel thank you
[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): i dont believe this i will never watch your show buy any of your products or brake if i see you crossing the street wow thats cold
[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): dear sleaze merchant -- now come on that hurts

[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): this is myers im here with the writers listen youre so smart how do we end this picture
[i s international] (marge simpson): well whats the problem youre having
[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): okay here it is itchy just stole scratchys ice cream cone
[i s international] (animator): make it a pie pies are easier to draw
[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): okay a pie anyway scratchy is understandably upset
[i s international] (marge simpson): huh huh
[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): so we figured he could - you know - just grab itchy and toss him in a bucket of acid
[i s international] (marge simpson): oh dear
[i s international] (roger meyers, jr.): but then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now thanks to you so whats your big idea how do we end this
