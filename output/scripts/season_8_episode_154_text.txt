[simpson home] (dr. julius hibbert): and hillbillies prefer to be called sons of the soil but it aint gonna happen now normally the birth of siamese twins is a joyous occasion but unfortunately one of them was pure evil
[simpson home] (marge simpson): i think ill bottle-feed that one
[simpson home] (dr. julius hibbert): a routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil it was then i knew the only option was to separate you two immediately

[simpson home] (dr. julius hibbert): but what to do with poor hugo too crazy for boys town too much of a boy for crazy town the child was an outcast so we did the only humane thing
[simpson home] (homer simpson): we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week
[simpson home] (marge simpson): it saved our marriage
