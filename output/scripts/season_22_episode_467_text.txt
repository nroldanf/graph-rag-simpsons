[moe tavern] (homer simpson): hey pal howya doin
[moe tavern] (lisa simpson): fine i was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy
[moe tavern] (moe szyslak): the only thing i know about strategy is that whatever the manager does its wrong unless it works in which case hes a button-pusher
[moe tavern] (lenny leonard): i hate guys that just push buttons all day
[moe tavern] (carl carlson): you just push buttons all day
[moe tavern] (lenny leonard): you know ever since obama came in youve got all the answers dont you
[moe tavern] (lisa simpson): does anyone here actually know anything about baseball
[moe tavern] (moe szyslak): uh the guys in that booth down there
[moe tavern] (gary): as a pitcher cliff lee is clearly superior to zack grienke
[moe tavern] (professor jonathan frink): uh yes i completely agree with the following colossal exception before the fourth inning after a road loss in a domed stadium then its good to be grienke unless hes got a bunion in which case he is notably ineffective
[moe tavern] (lisa simpson): wow im surprised you guys know so much about a sport
[moe tavern] (professor jonathan frink): oh lisa baseball is a game played by the dexterous but only understood by the poin-dexterous do you understand what i laid out there
[moe tavern] (doug): the key to understanding the game is sabermetrics
[moe tavern] (lisa simpson): huh
[moe tavern] (professor jonathan frink): the field was developed by statistician bill james
[moe tavern] (bill james): i made baseball as fun as doing your taxes
[moe tavern] (professor jonathan frink): using sabermetrics even an eight-year-old girl can run a ballclub with the sagacity of a stengel and the single-mindedness of a steinbrenner i call it a stein-stengel-
[moe tavern] (lisa simpson): thanks guys
[moe tavern] (moe szyslak): hey speaking of stats im none too pleased about your ratio of seats occupied to beers ordered
[moe tavern] (gary): you mean our sobo lets calculate it now

[moe tavern] (gary): refreshingness over effervescence
[moe tavern] (benjamin): plus or minus tang
