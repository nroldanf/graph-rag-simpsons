[courtroom] (blue-haired lawyer): mrs simpson what is your opinion of dr riviera and let me remind you that youre under oath
[courtroom] (marge simpson): well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes even a doctor
[courtroom] (blue-haired lawyer): and mrs simpson could you describe for us in your own words barts intense mental anguish and suffering

[courtroom] (burns lawyer): oh three days
[courtroom] (marge simpson): although he doesnt really like school all that much
[courtroom] (burns lawyer): no
[courtroom] (marge simpson): so i guess that may not count as anguish

[courtroom] (burns lawyer): yes
[courtroom] (marge simpson): all that time
[courtroom] (blue-haired lawyer): could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships
[courtroom] (marge simpson): well we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash

[courtroom] (blue-haired lawyer): five dollars
