[simpson home] (homer simpson): correct now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck but why does the american flag have precisely 47 stars
[simpson home] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date the library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after new mexico became a state but before arizona did
