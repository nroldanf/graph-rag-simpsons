[springfield pharmaceuticals] (homer simpson): problem solved generation awesome does it again
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (grampa simpson): all right you googly-eyed geezers turn up your hearing aids -- ive got something to say
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (grampa simpson): together we survived the depression won a few wars and put a man on the moon in fact the only mistake our generation made was creating that generation
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (grampa simpson): if we want to set these bumblers straight its going to take all the crankiness we can muster so put down those pills pop in your eyeballs and upside-down them smiles
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (homer simpson): their can-do will bail out our wont-try every time
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (lisa simpson): so i guess the lesson here is
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (seymour skinner): if you go on a field trip dont break off from the group
[springfield pharmaceuticals] (walther hotenhoffer): and if you are a fat little boy in a chocolate factory never try to drink from the river the tube my god every night i see the tube
