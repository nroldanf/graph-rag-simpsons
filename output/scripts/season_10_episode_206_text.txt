[kwik-e-mart] (bart simpson): no dont hurt them ill just keep them as pets
[kwik-e-mart] (seymour skinner): no they might escape and breed the law is very clear on this they must be exterminated as quickly and as gruesomely as possible

[municipal building] (seymour skinner): well i hope youre happy bart you have no idea what kind of plague youve unleashed upon this town
[municipal building] (kent brockman): our top story the population of parasitic tree lizards has exploded -- and local citizens couldnt be happier it seems the rapacious reptiles have developed a taste for the common pigeon also known as the feathered rat or gutter bird
[municipal building] (kent brockman): for the first time citizens need not fear harassment by flocks of chattering disease-bags
[springfield park] (mayor joe quimby): for decimating our pigeon population and making springfield a less oppressive place to while away our worthless lives i present you with this scented candle
[springfield park] (townspeople): yay woo-hoo all right
[springfield park] (seymour skinner): well i was wrong the lizards are a godsend
[springfield park] (lisa simpson): but isnt that a bit short-sighted what happens when were overrun by lizards
[springfield park] (seymour skinner): no problem we simply unleash wave after wave of chinese needle snakes theyll wipe out the lizards
[springfield park] (lisa simpson): but arent the snakes even worse
[springfield park] (seymour skinner): yes but were prepared for that weve lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat
[springfield park] (lisa simpson): but then were stuck with gorillas
[springfield park] (seymour skinner): no thats the beautiful part when wintertime rolls around the gorillas simply freeze to death
[springfield park] (homer simpson): im proud of you boy mmmm loganberry
[springfield park] (lisa simpson): i dont get it bart you got all upset when you killed one bird but now youve killed tens of thousands and it doesnt bother you at all
