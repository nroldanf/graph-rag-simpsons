[moe tavern] (lenny leonard): so anyway -- and this is the part youll remember for the rest of your lives
[moe tavern] (homer simpson): yeah yeah yeah yeah great story lenny but heres one thats even more spellbinding once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph
[moe tavern] (homer simpson): and he was a firm believer in fletcherism and he played the organ and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh and his middle name was alva and he never ever ever wore pajamas and

[moe tavern] (carl carlson): uh james watt invented the steam engine
[moe tavern] (homer simpson): thats boring youre boring everybody quit boring everyone
[simpson home] (homer simpson): and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead some kind of scary telephone i guess or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell
[simpson home] (marge simpson): all right already everyone knows the man accomplished a lot maybe because he didnt spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison
[simpson home] (homer simpson): ohh thats where youre wrong marge he was a shameless self-promoter
[simpson home] (marge simpson): well youre not thomas edison
[simpson home] (homer simpson): marge thats it thats why i havent done anything with my life i need to be more like thomas edison
[simpson home] (marge simpson): whatever

[simpson home] (marge simpson): i didnt tell you to quit your job
[simpson home] (homer simpson): yes you did i remember your exact words you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or youd torch the house
[simpson home] (marge simpson): that doesnt sound like me well i suppose if this doesnt work out you can always go back to the plant
[simpson home] (homer simpson): not the way i quit ooh-who
[basement] (homer simpson): at my age edison had already invented 203 things ohh ive got a lot of work to do to catch up to him
[basement] (homer simpson): lets see now inventions inventions
[basement] (marge simpson): something electrical might be good
[basement] (homer simpson): what eh eh let me handle the creative end of this marge you dont understand how the creative mind works like i do
[basement] (marge simpson): oh
[basement] (homer simpson): you look at this table and what do you see just a table now a creative person like me looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables
[basement] (marge simpson): homer thats not a table thats our dryer

[basement] (homer simpson): uh this isnt working ive got to try a different approach
[basement] (lisa simpson): youve started smoking dad

[basement] (bart simpson): yeah he invented stuff too
[basement] (homer simpson): shutup
[basement] (homer simpson): as long as youre here annoying me lets have a brainstorming session now heres how it works lisa you say one thing then bart you say another just toss out things and ill use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea

[basement] (bart simpson): butt
[basement] (homer simpson): okay
[basement] (lisa simpson): fluorescent
[basement] (bart simpson): booger
[basement] (homer simpson): uh-huh

[frink house] (professor jonathan frink): and these should give you the grounding youll need in thermodynamics hyper-mathematics and of course microcalifragilistics
[frink house] (homer simpson): look i just want to know how to invent things tell me
[frink house] (professor jonathan frink): well all you have to do is think of things that people need but which dont exist yet
[frink house] (homer simpson): you mean like an electric blanketmobile
[frink house] (professor jonathan frink): possibleh or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it like--
[frink house] (homer simpson): hamburger earmuffs

[simpson home] (homer simpson): in the olden times if you were watching tv and nature called youd have to get up and walk to the bathroom it was the hardest thing in the world to do but now with the lazy man reclining toilet chair you can just lean back and let er rip

[simpson home] (homer simpson): what
[simpson home] (marge simpson): im not saying youre a bad inventor im just saying these particular inventions are awful and no one in their right mind would buy them or accept them as gifts
[simpson home] (homer simpson): but this is the best i could do i guess im no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson
[simpson home] (marge simpson): oh dear i hope i wasnt too rough on him
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): somebody had to tell him mom in the long run its much kinder to--
[simpson home] (bart simpson): do you mind
[simpson home] (homer simpson): all week my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison but now its over i guess ill just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): homer dad look out
[simpson home] (marge simpson): what happened you didnt fall
[simpson home] (homer simpson): oh that i stuck a couple of extra legs on there cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff

[simpson home] (homer simpson): awdammit
[simpson home] (bart simpson): hey dad heard you swearing mind if i join in crap boobs crap

[simpson home] (bart simpson): if edison thought of that chair how come its not on this chart
[simpson home] (homer simpson): its not maybe he never told anyone about it
[simpson home] (homer simpson): that chair might be the only one he made
[simpson home] (bart simpson): so
[simpson home] (homer simpson): so weve got to go to the edison museum and smash it then ill be an inventor
[simpson home] (bart simpson): but i thought you loved edison

[edison laboratory] (tour guide): just one thomas edison
[edison laboratory] (visitor): thats very good
[edison laboratory] (female visitor): and its true too its funny and true
[edison laboratory] (tour guide): now behind that door is edisons actual preserved brain
[edison laboratory] (tour guide): ordinarily folks tour groups are not allowed to see it and of course today will be no exception
[edison laboratory] (tour guide): now no tour would be complete without a visit to edisons boyhood gift shop
[edison laboratory] (crowd): ohh well now that id like to see yes
[edison laboratory] (homer simpson): now lets take care of business
[edison laboratory] (homer simpson): outta the way this is one invention youre not getting credit for you inspiration hog

[edison laboratory] (homer simpson): look son edison was just like me
[edison laboratory] (bart simpson): you mean the wild mood swings
[edison laboratory] (homer simpson): no we both lived in another mans shadow this old-timey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache
[edison laboratory] (homer simpson): were not rivals were just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high i cant destroy your work my friend

[edison laboratory] (bart simpson): uh i think thats in italy dad
[edison laboratory] (homer simpson): oh well then well take it out on eli whitney
[simpson home] (kent brockman): authorities say the phony pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth in other news thomas edison the greatest inventor of all timeis apparently still inventing despite the notable handicap of being dead
[simpson home] (homer simpson): thats my tommy
[simpson home] (kent brockman): two new edison creations have just been discovered in his museum a six-legged chair that wont tip over
[simpson home] (kent brockman): and even more astounding an electric hammer
[simpson home] (marge simpson): that was your idea
[simpson home] (kent brockman): this brilliant innovation is expected to generate millions for edisons already wealthy heirs
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): dad those should be your millions
[simpson home] (bart simpson): i gotta admit homer youre taking this pretty well
[simpson home] (homer simpson): lets just say im sitting in the right chair
