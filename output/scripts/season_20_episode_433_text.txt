[clock tower] (comic book guy): following you we seek the gem of saint teresa
[clock tower] (lisa simpson): oh well i seek it so i can find my sister how do you know about the gem
[clock tower] (comic book guy): we are an ancient order of mystery buffs who hide in shadow and call ourselves the brethren of the quest
[clock tower] (seymour skinner): because we do our sleuthing in mothers nissan quest minivan
[clock tower] (lisa simpson): tell me all you know about the gem
[clock tower] (seymour skinner): never
[clock tower] (lisa simpson): does your mother know youre using her minivan
[clock tower] (seymour skinner): you see legend has it that on her deathbed saint teresa of avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony
[convent] (seymour skinner): she dispatched a team of nuns to the new world to seek this fabulous gem
[sailing ship] (seymour skinner): they landed at what is now philadelphiaand used the timbers of their ship to construct a convent
[field near beach] (seymour skinner): the order flourished never forgetting its sacred mission but word about the gem got outand a group of high-ranking freemasons led by benjamin franklin george washington and king george the third staged a phony war of independence to cover their search for the gem
[field near beach] (seymour skinner): fleeing the violence the nuns of saint teresas left the colonies and settled here in springfield
[bell tower] (comic book guy): legend and wikipedia have it that the gem will be revealed during the first full moon after a solar eclipse
[bell tower] (lisa simpson): thats tonight
[bell tower] (comic book guy): adoy one question remains why did you come here
[bell tower] (lisa simpson): because i cleverly deduced the answer to springfields biggest ring voila
[bell tower] (comic book guy): well it gives me no pleasure to say your deduction was faulty
[bell tower] (comic book guy): this is a fake papier-mâché bell the real bell was melted down in world war two to make civil war chess sets four of which i own
[bell tower] (lisa simpson): oh my god i know what the biggest ring in springfield is its been right in front of us the whole time
[bell tower] (comic book guy): ah yes i see it
[bell tower] (seymour skinner): i see it too lets uh head that way well walk or drive to the obvious solution

[hillside near springfield sign] (seymour skinner): great crimes kill holy sage the puzzle is solved we must warn the holy sage at once
[hillside near springfield sign] (lisa simpson): no thats not it a secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram
[hillside near springfield sign] (c. montgomery burns): fine then you unscramble those letters to spell out the location of the gem while you two dig your own graves
[hillside near springfield sign] (comic book guy): superman i have believed in you for years if you can hear me now please come help me dig this giant grave
[hillside near springfield sign] (lisa simpson): so the anagram spells regally the rock gem is

[hillside near springfield sign] (lisa simpson): it all adds up i am the gem that will bring world peace how brilliant of god to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one
[hillside near springfield sign] (comic book guy): according to legend the gem must be brought to the convent by sunrise
[hillside near springfield sign] (seymour skinner): we could make it if we took mr burnss helicopter
