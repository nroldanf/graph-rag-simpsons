[foyer] (seymour skinner): hello mrs simpson im afraid theres been a very disturbing incident at school today
[foyer] (bart simpson): im outta here man
[foyer] (marge simpson): homer principal skinners here
[foyer] (homer simpson): oh hello principal skinner id get up but the boy crippled me
[foyer] (seymour skinner): mmm-hmm i understand completely the disturbing incident i was referring to happened this morning when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys lavatory
[foyer] (homer simpson): that old gag
[foyer] (seymour skinner): unfortunately at the same moment my mother was in the girls lavatory making use of the facilities
[foyer] (marge simpson): oh dear
[foyer] (seymour skinner): mr and mrs simpson we have transcended incorrigible i dont think suspension or expulsion will do the trick i think it behooves us all to consider deportation
[foyer] (marge simpson): deportation you mean kick bart out of the country
[foyer] (homer simpson): hear him out marge
[foyer] (seymour skinner): well perhaps i was being a tad glib let me explain our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program now normally a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence but in barts case im prepared to make a big exception and if youre willing to play along he can spend the next three months studying far far away
[foyer] (homer simpson): sounds great although a kid cant learn much in just three months
[foyer] (marge simpson): homer you didnt even ask where bart would be going
[foyer] (seymour skinner): actually hed be staying in france in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country
[foyer] (marge simpson): but bart doesnt speak french
[foyer] (seymour skinner): oh when hes totally immersed in a foreign language the average child can become fluent in weeks
[foyer] (homer simpson): yeah but what about bart
[foyer] (seymour skinner): im sure hell pick up enough to get by and the whole thing wont cost you a dime as long youre willing to take in a student of your own
[foyer] (homer simpson): wait a minute skinner how do we know some principal over in france isnt pulling the same scam you are
[foyer] (seymour skinner): well for one thing you wouldnt be getting a french boy you would be getting an albanian
[foyer] (homer simpson): you mean all white with pink eyes
[foyer] (seymour skinner): no no no no a student from albania its a country on the adriatic sea
[foyer] (marge simpson): well going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity but i think bart should have a say in this
[bart bedroom] (bart simpson): aah the life of a frog thats the life for me
[bart bedroom] (marge simpson): bart how would you like to spend the next three months living in france
[bart bedroom] (bart simpson): france wow
