[flanders] (rev. timothy lovejoy): you know ned the bible never explicitly condemns gambling biblical folks were always playing games of chance like uh drawing lots
[flanders] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): card counting is not gambling it is math
[flanders] (marge simpson): and its not even against the rules
[flanders] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): exactly if you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime the worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers but what is a little pain if your church is to be saved
[flanders] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): it is all good
[kwik-e-mart] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): counting cards requires absolute focus you must ignore all casino distractions
[kwik-e-mart] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): and beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage theyre not attractive but you cannot look away

[riverboat casino] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): card counting is simple
[riverboat casino] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): you all sit at different tables betting low playing hand after hand counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck
[riverboat casino] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): ignore all distractions
[riverboat casino] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): when the count is high you have a hot deck and the odds are in your favor then you use a secret signal to call in the closer
[riverboat casino] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): the closer bets big wins bigger and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally-acceptable screw job
[riverboat casino] (apu nahasapeemapetilon): but use caution there are eyes everywhere sooner or later the casino will catch on
