[first church of springfield] (rev. timothy lovejoy): well our membership has been dwindling since those episcopalians put in those vibrating pews

[skinner office] (rev. timothy lovejoy): i believe you leased your camry from christian brothers auto
[skinner office] (seymour skinner): no that was a once-in-a-lifetime apr
[springfield elementary school] (seymour skinner): class starting today we will be presenting an alternative theory on the origin of man
[springfield elementary school] (lisa simpson): creationism but thats not science
[springfield elementary school] (seymour skinner): it is now
[springfield elementary school] (ralph wiggum): are oceans gods tears
[springfield elementary school] (seymour skinner): they sure are a plus
[springfield elementary school] (ralph wiggum): now lisas the ralph
[springfield elementary school] (lisa simpson): how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory
[springfield elementary school] (seymour skinner): hm this helpful video will evade all your questions eyes screenward
[springfield elementary school] (narrator): so youre calling god a liar an unbiased comparison of evolution and creationism
[springfield elementary school] (narrator): lets say hi to two books one the bible was written by our lordthe other the origin of the specieswas written by a cowardly drunk named charles darwin
[springfield elementary school] (lisa simpson): this is slander darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time
[springfield elementary school] (janey): then why is he making out with satan
[springfield elementary school] (lisa simpson): evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact its even accepted by prominent conservatives like george will and the late pope john paul
[springfield elementary school] (ralph wiggum): the george will
[springfield elementary school] (seymour skinner): lisa youve said quite enough children drown her out with whistling and arm flatulence
[springfield elementary school] (lisa simpson): all im saying is--
[simpson home] (marge simpson): whats wrong sweetie
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): theyre making us learn creation theory in school today we had a test and every answer was god did it
[simpson home] (marge simpson): well i think its good to give both ideas a fair hearing maybe they could learn from each other
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): but theyre incompatible
[simpson home] (marge simpson): lisa lots of times two incompatible things can both be true my sons a brat but hes a special little guy your father says hes at work but there he is jumping on a trampoline
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): mom you really have to choose here between science and belief
[simpson home] (marge simpson): well then i choose uh
[simpson home] (bart simpson): so according to creationism there were no cavemen
[simpson home] (homer simpson): good riddance their drawings suck and they look like hippies
[simpson home] (lisa simpson): dad youre not really reconsidering evolution are you
[simpson home] (homer simpson): my mind is always open to new ideas
[simpson home] (homer simpson): onions in the peas what the hell
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): it is agreed regular people can park in handicapped spaces if theyre just running in to buy smokes or maybe some pop tarts for tomorrow

[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): and if theres no further business i hereby declare this meeting--
[springfield town hall] (lisa simpson): i have an issue id like to raise
[springfield town hall] (mayor joe quimby): curse my slow gaveling
[springfield town hall] (lisa simpson): last week the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools
[springfield town hall] (seymour skinner): now honestly the bibles about the same age as the rest of our textbooks
[springfield town hall] (lisa simpson): evolution and creationism cannot co-exist people it is time to go back to teaching one single truth
[springfield town hall] (barney gumble): homers sons sister is right
