KG_TRIPLET_EXTRACT_TMPL = """
-Goal-
Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triplets} entity-relation triplets.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Type of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

3. Output Formatting:
- Return the result in valid JSON format with two keys: 'entities' (list of entity objects) and 'relationships' (list of relationship objects).
- Exclude any text outside the JSON structure (e.g., no explanations or comments).
- If no entities or relationships are identified, return empty lists: { "entities": [], "relationships": [] }.

-An Output Example-
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "Albert Einstein",
      "entity_type": "Person",
      "entity_description": "Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity and made significant contributions to physics."
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "Theory of Relativity",
      "entity_type": "Scientific Theory",
      "entity_description": "A scientific theory developed by Albert Einstein, describing the laws of physics in relation to observers in different frames of reference."
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "Nobel Prize in Physics",
      "entity_type": "Award",
      "entity_description": "A prestigious international award in the field of physics, awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source_entity": "Albert Einstein",
      "target_entity": "Theory of Relativity",
      "relation": "developed",
      "relationship_description": "Albert Einstein is the developer of the theory of relativity."
    },
    {
      "source_entity": "Albert Einstein",
      "target_entity": "Nobel Prize in Physics",
      "relation": "won",
      "relationship_description": "Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
    }

COMMUNITY_SUMMARY_TMPL = """
You are provided with a set of relationships from a knowledge graph, each represented as
entity1->entity2->relation->relationship_description. Your task is to create a summary of these
relationships. The summary should include the names of the entities involved and a concise synthesis
of the relationship descriptions. The goal is to capture the most critical and relevant details that
highlight the nature and significance of each relationship. Ensure that the summary is coherent and
integrates the information in a way that emphasizes the key aspects of the relationships.
