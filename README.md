# The RAGening: what retrieval can learn form a certain animated town.
**A workshop on Retrieval-Augmented Generation using The Simpsons Dataset.**

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and resources used in our hands-on workshop that explores:

- What Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is and why it matters  
- How to build a basic RAG pipeline using Open Source tools + OpenAI too
- What Graph-RAG is and how it improves on standard RAG  
- How to apply both approaches using *The Simpsons Dataset*

##  Workshop Sections

1. **Context**  
   Previous context on LLMs and retrieval

2. **Intro to RAG**  
   Chunking, embeddings, vector stores, retrievers, and generation.

3. **Dataset Exploration**  
   Basic exploration of the dataset to understand what we are working with

4. **Hands-On RAG**  
   Build your own RAG pipeline using LangChain and FAISS.

5. **Limitations & Motivation for Graph RAG**  
   Where RAG falls short and how GraphRAG can help solve some of these issues.

6. **Graph RAG Deep Dive**  
   How connecting entities improves retrieval and answer grounding.

7. **Hands-On GraphRAG**  
   Using LLMs to extract relationships and build a basic knowledge graph.
